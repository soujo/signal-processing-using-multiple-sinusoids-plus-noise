# Signal Analysis and Processing

This repository contains MATLAB code for generating and analyzing a complex signal composed of sine waves and noise. The code performs various tasks, including generating the signal, applying filtering, computing statistical features, analyzing time-domain characteristics, and visualizing the results.

## Overview

The code performs the following main tasks:

1. **Signal Generation**: A complex signal is generated by summing multiple sine waves with different frequencies, amplitudes, and phase offsets. Noise is then added to the signal to simulate real-world conditions.

2. **Filtering**: A low-pass Butterworth filter is designed and applied to the noisy signal. This helps in removing high-frequency noise components.

3. **Statistical Analysis**: The code calculates statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the filtered signal.

4. **Time-Domain Analysis**: Time-domain characteristics of the filtered signal, including rise time and decay time, are analyzed.

5. **Frequency Analysis**: The frequency spectrum of the filtered signal is computed using the FFT (Fast Fourier Transform), and the frequency content is visualized.

6. **Spectrogram**: A spectrogram of the filtered signal is generated to visualize how its frequency content changes over time.

## Mathematical Equation of the Signal

The signal is represented by the following mathematical equation:

$$
x(t) = A_1 \cdot \sin(2\pi f_1 t + \phi_1) + A_2 \cdot \sin(2\pi f_2 t + \phi_2) + A_3 \cdot \sin(2\pi f_3 t + \phi_3) + \text{noise}(t)
$$

Where:
- $$ A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3} \textnormal{ are the amplitudes of the sine waves}$$
- $$ f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3} \textnormal{ are the frequencies of the sine waves.} $$
- $$ \phi_{1},\phi_{2},\phi_{3} \textnormal{ are the phase offsets of the sine waves.} $$
- $$ t \textnormal{ is the time}$$
- $$  noise \big(t\big) \textnormal{ represents the added noise.}$$

## Initial Values 

$$
\begin{split}
    &A_{1}=1\\    
    &A_{2}=0.5\\
    &A_{3}=3\\
    &f_{1}=50\\    
    &f_{2}=120\\
    &f_{3}=250\\
    &\phi_{1}=0\\
    &\phi_{2}=2\Pi/3\\
    &\phi_{3}=13\Pi/6\\
\end{split}
$$
